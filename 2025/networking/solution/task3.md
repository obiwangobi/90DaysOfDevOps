# AWS EC2 and Security Groups

This document is focuses on launching an Amazon EC2 instance and configuring Security Groups to secure your cloud instance. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a scalable compute service provided by AWS, while Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic.

## Prerequisites

- An active [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Types=*all&awsf.Free%20Tier%20Categories=*all)
- Basic understanding of [networking concepts](https://devops-easy.hashnode.dev/mastering-networking-protocols-and-ports) (IP addresses, ports, and protocols)

## Step 1: Launch an AWS EC2 Instance

### Sign in to AWS Console

- Go to AWS Management Console
- Navigate to the EC2 service (by Searching)
- Ensure you're in your desired AWS region

### Instance Configuration

1. Click "Launch Instance"
2. Configure basic details:
   - Name: Provide a meaningful name for your instance
   - Tags: Add relevant tags for resource management

3. Choose Amazon Machine Image (AMI):
   - Select "Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS (HVM)"
   - Filter for "Free tier eligible" if needed

4. Select Instance Type:
   - Choose "t2.micro" (Free tier eligible)
   - vCPU: 1
   - Memory: 1 GiB

5. Network Settings:
   - VPC: Select your VPC
   - Subnet: Choose a public subnet
   - Auto-assign Public IP: Enable


### 3. Configure Key Pair

When prompted to select a key pair, you can either:

1. Create a new key pair:
    - Provide a key pair name.
    - Select RSA as the key type and PEM as the file format.
      - Private key file format: .pem (for OpenSSH) or .ppk (for PuTTY)

    - Download the key pair file. Keep it secure as it is required for SSH access.
      - Linux/macOS: Store in `~/.ssh/` with permissions `chmod 400`
      - Windows: Store in a secure location

2. Use an existing key pair:
    - Select from previously created key pairs if available.

## Step 2: Configure Security Groups

Security Groups act as virtual firewalls that control traffic to and from your instance.

### Inbound Rules

Inbound rules define what traffic is allowed to reach your instance.

1. Allow SSH Access:
    - Protocol: TCP
    - Port Range: 22
    - Source: Custom IP range (Recommended) or Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0) (less secure)
    - Description: SSH access from approved IPs

2. Allow HTTP Traffic: (if needed)
    - Protocol: TCP
    - Port Range: 80
    - Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Description: Web access

3. Allow HTTPS Traffic: (if needed)
    - Protocol: TCP
    - Port Range: 8443
    - Source: Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)
    - Description: Secure web access


### Outbound Rules

Default outbound rule (recommended for most cases):

- Type: All traffic
- Protocol: All
- Port Range: All
- Destination: 0.0.0.0/0

## Step 3: Launch the Instance and Connect

1. Review and Launch:
    - Review your configuration and click "Launch Instance"
    - Wait for the instance to become "Running"
    - Note the public IP address

2. Connect to the Instance:
    - Once the instance is running, click Connect.

    -Use the provided instructions to connect via SSH.
      - Example command for SSH:

        ```bash
        chmod 400 path/to/your-key-pair.pem
        ssh -i "path/to/your-key-pair.pem" ubuntu@your-instance-public-ip
        ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully launched an AWS EC2 instance and configured its Security Groups. Proper configuration of Security Groups is essential for maintaining the security of your cloud environment.
